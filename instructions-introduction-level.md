# Instruction for the introduction level (text for thingiverse and printable)

While achieving the same quality as a factory-made telescope may be challenging, there's something truly exciting about making your own. Maybe it's the joy of handling lenses, seeing how they magnify, and then putting the telescope together to help you see faraway things more clearly. Or maybe it's the drive to understand the conditions that astronomers faced in the 15th century. This description outlines how you can easily construct a telescope on par with the instruments that Galileo and Kepler worked with. Below, is first a brief explanation of optics which briefly describes how a telescope works and then the instruction how to build this telescope. For a deeper understanding of optics, a course in basic optics is recommended.

We can perceive the world around us thanks to the information that light carries from various objects. Our eyes act as sensors that decode this information carried by light. Our eyes receive an abundance of information from all sorts of objects around us. Information comes at us from various angles, but luckily, the eye has a flexible lens that can be adjusted to focus on the object we are observing. This allows the information carried by the light from the object we're looking at to be the one that is displayed for us.

It's the size of the pupil in the eye that determines how much information from light we can intake. When it's dark, the pupil can expand to a diameter of 8 mm, providing an area of about 0.5 cm. If we had a larger pupil, it would enhance our ability to gather light, allowing us to see better in darkness, for instance. There are other processes in the eye that affect the capacity to absorb light, but for this description, understanding the pupil is sufficient.

What a telescope does is increase the amount of information an eye can capture while simultaneously magnifying the image that information represents. By focusing light from a large area onto a smaller one, the eye can receive more concentrated information.

A telescope with an objective lens of 5 cm in diameter has an area of approximately 19.6 cmÂ². If all that light can be collected and presented to the pupil, it provides a collecting area that is approximately 39 times larger than gathering information solely with the pupil. It's the increased area of information gathered by the eye that enables us to discern details from objects in the sky that we otherwise wouldn't be able to see.

The interaction between the objective lens and the eyepiece creates the magnification. Magnification occurs when the objective lens refracts light less than the eyepiece. The following formula calculates a telescope's magnification:
Magnification = Focal length of the objective / Focal length of the eyepiece
The formula for magnification is straightforward, and a basic optics course can provide a deeper explanation of this relationship. The next step is to find two lenses to build the telescope."

# Purchasing Optics

Acquiring lenses for the telescope constitutes the challenging part of this project. For this project, it is recommended to procure a lens suitable for the telescope's objective and to obtain an eyepiece following the 1.25-inch standard. Attempt to find a lens with a focal length of 30, 40, or 50 cm and print out the corresponding telescope tube.

If you acquire a lens with a short focal length, you can use the following project to build your own 1.25-inch eyepiece.

A good lens that refracts light with minimal disturbances tends to be quite expensive. However, for this project, the challenge is to find an inexpensive lens with the goal that it's sufficiently precise to capture the larger craters on the moon. The table below presents some pre-generated measurements for various objectives (Add a comment if additional measurements are desired).

# Building the telescope

All parts can be printed using PLA, 0,3 mm is recommended for layer heigth. Print all parts with a brim.

This telescope will consist of a objective that is connected to a optical tube and a focuser tube.

Print the lens enclosuer that will fits to your lens. If the lens enclsur is sligthly to small, than you can adjust it using a hair dryer.

Put the lens inside the lens enclouser.

<img alt="The lens enclosure" src="images/lens-enclosure-introduction-level-telescope.jpg" />

Push the lens enclosure on the objective.

Put the focuser tube inside the optical tube.

<img alt="The focuser tube before inserting it in the optical tube" src="images/the-focuser-tube-introduction-level-telescope.jpg" />

Push the objective on to the focuser tube.

Insert a 1.25-inch eyepiece and the telescope is ready to use.
