# The poor man's telescope

This is a crude and simple telescope that doesn't assume any major knowledge about astronomy in order to get a glance of our neighborhood in the universe. It’s actually a Keplerian style telescope which is an improved version of the Galilean telescope.

A Keplerian style telescope consists of two convex lenses which allow for a wider field of view compared with the Galilean telescope. Apart from the two lenses, the only additional parts needed is this “print in place” telescope tube which also includes the lens holder for the objective and eyepiece / ocular.

The big challenge when building this telescope is to find two convex lenses. The focal length, diameter and the thickness of the lens are parameters that the telescope tube must adapt to.
Luckily there is no need to provide a stl file for each combination of lenses. Use OpenCAD and specify your settings in the Spreadsheet.

The following parameters will let you create a telescope based on the lenses that you have. 

| LENS SETTINGS                  |      |                                                |
|--------------------------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
| Objective lens radius	         | 25	  |The diameter of the objective lens              |
| Objective lens thickness       | 2.5	| The outer thickness of the objective lens      |
| Objective focal length         | 300  |	The focal length of the objective lens         |
| Eyepiece / Ocular lens radios  | 15.1 | The radios of the eyepiece / ocular lens       |
| Eyepiece / Ocular focal length | 25   |	The focal length of the eyepiece / ocular lens |
